# week-1-code-refactoring-challenge

## Code refactor of the Horiseon homepage to comply with modern semantic tagging practices, improve search engine optimisation and follow accessibility standards

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Problems Solved

- Improved the title of the webpage
- Updated the old HTML tags with semantic tags
- Added alt text to all of the images on the webpage
- Added id selector for 'search-engine-optimization' anchor
- Removed unnecessary CSS selectors and updated naming in CSS and HTML  to reflect this
- Added comments to HTML and CSS
